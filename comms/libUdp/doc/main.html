<b>Program developed for CP Labs</b>



<b>Task:</b>

   Develop C++ library of classes for TCP/IP and UDP/IP under Unix systems
   with a programm which demostrates its usage.
   This demo programm is similar to ICQ (client and server).


<b>Problem analysis and solution method:</b>

   The library allows TCP and UDP connections for server as well as client,
   however it is not very universal :(
   
   Serwer uses TCP/IP protocol. It sends messages recived from one client
   to all other connected clients.
   Client connects to the server, then sends and recives messages to/from its.
   Application uses port number 3999.


<b>Conclusions:</b>
